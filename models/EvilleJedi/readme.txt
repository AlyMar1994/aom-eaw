-----------------------------------------

This is just a mirror of the model packs EvilleJedi released here nearly 10 years ago since they're no longer hosted by him and are hard to find now. The models in these packs are superb, give them a once-over and judge for yourself. :thumbs:
Screenshot galleries of his work.

EvilleJedi has uploaded some things back onto his site here:

You'll find a few gems there as well.
