I don't plan on using this, someone else might find use for it though
It's the Mark 6 Supremacy fighter from SWTOR. The model is a kitbash between Warb's and Bioware's. I did the texture though
IIRC, I went 1k on the textures for it.
That's been doing fine for me in RA
Yeah, everything I do uses mirrored UVs for better resolution

Model - Bioware and Warb
Texture and rig - Sergeant Barlex
Particle - YVaW
