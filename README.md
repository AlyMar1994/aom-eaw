## Association of Modders - EMPIRE AT WAR
In the spirit of preserving and sharing open-sourced assets and community packs, this GitHub has been made in the spirit of [CaptainLuck's Association of Modders II.](https://github.com/captainluckloveslorde/aom2)  This repo is dedicated to preserving all types of EaW assets by type and author; because, unfortunately, Google Drives go down, websites become defunct, and hard drives fail.

Not to say that GitHub can't fail, but collecting them here as another mirror isn't a bad idea.

### Usage
All assets are organized as follows:
- Root/Type (f.e. "Audio") ->
- - Author(s) (f.e. "\Megabalta\" or "Farseer,The" or "evilbobthebob & Jeroenimo") ->
- - - Item/Pack Name (f.e. "Public Models (2016-2020)" or "StarViper/Virago Fighter HD") ->
- - - - Items & readme/credits

All items here are free-to-use unto the restrictions of their readme/license.  All items here are contributed in the best spirits by their creator.  All items here may or may not have support attached, please do not go out of your way to harrass an author because something went wrong, treat it as a last resort.

Always credit the creator.  Read the readme/credits.  Include the readme/credits.

### Contributing
Anyone can have their assets removed at any time, but I implore [you/author] to reconsider at every angle why that isn't a good idea, even if [it] wasn't your best work.  All versions can be saved here.

Anyone can publish assets as long as they don't invoke some direct copyright violation.  Make a pull request following the directory specification in "USAGE," and it'll be closed as soon as possible and as long as there is a readme/credits file included.

If an author wishes to include a general, in-totality license/readme, they can request or place on in their Author folder.  Please contact @alymar1994 with any questions.  Contributors, such as administrators of the Modder's Hub, can be added at any time.
